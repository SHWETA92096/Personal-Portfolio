    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      M M Khakhrawala is a homegrown brand delivering healthy, crispy, and wholesome khakhra to your doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe that food made with love tastes better - and thats exactly what we deliver. Our journey began with a simple idea: to bring the authentic taste of khakhras to every household. Inspired by age-old family recipes and a passion for traditional Insian snacks, we started creating a range of Khakhras that not only taste delicious but also made with care, hygiene, and the finest ingredients.
    </p>
    <p>
        We specialize in a variety of flavours and pack sizes to suit every taste and need. From 40gm on-the-go packs, our range includes Plain, Masala, Jeera, Moong, and Methi Khakhras. Each Khakhra is hand-rolled, roasted to crispy perfection, and packed with flavour, offering a healthy and tasty snack option for people of all ages.
    </p>
    <p>
        What sets us apart is our commmitment to quality. Unlike mass-produced snacks, our Khakhras are made in small batches to ensure freshness and consistency. We use only premium-quality ingredients without any preservatives or artificial flavours. Every piece reflects our dedication to traditional methods, homemade taste, and customer satisfication.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our mission is not just to sell snacks, but to spread the joy of authentic Indian flavours that remind you of home. Whether you're enjoying tea time, packing lunchboxes, or looking for a light yet satisfying snack, our Khakhras are the perfect companion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for being a part of our journey. your trust and love motivate us to continue delivering homemade goodness to your doorstep, one crispy bite at a time.
